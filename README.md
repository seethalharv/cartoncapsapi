# CartonCaps Referral API (Mock Service)

This is a .NET Core-based mock API service implementing the referral system for the Carton Caps mobile app. 
The API enables users to invite friends, track referral status, and simulate referral redemptions using shareable deep links.
All solutions were created to be compatible with macOS and .NET 8 SDK.
However I have used only windows to develop this, so there might be some issues with macOS. 
So if you find any issues please feel free to reach out to me and I can try my best to fix it.

I will probably not respond to issues here, as I am not checking this repo regularly and since it was exclusively built for the CartonCaps project.
